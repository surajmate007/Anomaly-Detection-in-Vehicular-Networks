# Anomaly-Detection-in-Vehicular-Networks
In this project using Machine Learning I am trying to detect anomaly in Intra Vehicular Networks, 

How to Run this Code:
1. Run each notebook cell one by one.
2. The data should be present in the same folder where this notebook is present. Otherwise the data address should be changed.
